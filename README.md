# Temperature and Humidity Sensor Module (DHT11/DHT22)

#### Project Overview

The Temperature and Humidity Sensor Module project illustrates how to measure both temperature and humidity using DHT11 or DHT22 sensors with an Arduino Nano. These sensors provide digital output readings for temperature and humidity, making them ideal for environmental monitoring applications. This project demonstrates how to interface the sensor module with the Arduino Nano to obtain accurate temperature and humidity data.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **DHT11 or DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Sensor Module to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the signal/data pin of the DHT sensor to digital pin 2 on the Arduino Nano.
   - Ensure the sensor's power (VCC) and ground (GND) pins are connected to the appropriate pins on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the temperature and humidity sensor module to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor.
   - The serial monitor will display temperature and humidity readings in Celsius and percentage, respectively.
   - Observe the readings and verify their accuracy based on the ambient conditions.

#### Applications

- **Indoor Climate Monitoring:** Monitor temperature and humidity levels in indoor environments for comfort and health.
- **Greenhouse Control:** Use sensors to maintain optimal temperature and humidity conditions for plant growth in greenhouses.
- **HVAC Systems:** Integrate temperature and humidity sensors into heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems for efficient climate control.

#### Notes

- Sensor Selection: Choose between DHT11 and DHT22 based on accuracy and range requirements.
- Calibration: Calibrate the sensors if necessary to ensure accurate readings.
- Sensor Placement: Position sensors appropriately to avoid interference and ensure accurate measurements.
